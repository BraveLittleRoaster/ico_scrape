At the time this was created it would scrape Angel List for every single ICO, then use 3rd party sources like Pipl and WhitePages to correlate more data to dox. 
This data was later fed into another tool, like the WeLeakInfo CLI tool, in order to automate Social Engineering of ALL ICOs to understand the threat landscape for the emerging crypto currency technology companies, so I could better assist companies I worked with at mitigate Sim Swapping attacks, which were huge at the time. 

None of the API keys work anymore.

Oh yeah, also had a MetroPCS PIN # bruter. By feeding the phone number into Twilio, we could find which of these crypto currency tech workers used MetroPCS, then bypass the auth on their account and conduct a port of that number to an alternative SIM if required for engagments. I doubt the MetroPCS bruter works still. 

The IMAP dumper, would just feed in a username/password to an IMAP server and dump the contents of their mailbox. Mostly useful at ye olde ancient and unsecured AOL IMAP servers.
