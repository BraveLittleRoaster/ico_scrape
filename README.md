At the time this was created it would scrape Angel List for every single ICO, then use 3rd party sources like Pipl and WhitePages to correlate more data to dox. 
This data was later fed into another tool, like the WeLeakInfo CLI tool, in order to automate Social Engineering of ALL ICOs to understand the threat landscape for the emerging crypto currency technologyt companies, so I could better assist companies I worked with at mitigate Sim Swapping attacks, which were huge at the time. 

None of the API keys work anymore.
